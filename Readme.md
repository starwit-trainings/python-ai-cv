# Introduction to the Python programming language
This repository is part of a lecture, that shall teach students to use the Python programming language and modern software development tools like Git to do write software for data analysis and some selected AI algorithms. This is however not a course in AI and thus no algorithmic/mathematical foundations are explained here. 

This repository also contains examples and tutorials for selected interesting topics like networks, Kubernetes and cloud technologies.

Feel free to use this material for your teaching classes. However, please note [license note](License).

Detailed course description can be found in [markdown slides](slides.md), which can be viewed best with Marp extension for VSCode.
